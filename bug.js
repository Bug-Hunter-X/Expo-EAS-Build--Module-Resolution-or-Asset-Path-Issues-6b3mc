This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI with EAS Build and involves a mismatch between the project's configuration and the build system's expectations.  It might manifest as an inability to find or load certain modules, unexpected behavior during the build process, or cryptic error messages related to missing dependencies or incorrect asset paths.  The root cause often lies in inconsistencies between the package.json dependencies, the expo.json configuration, and the way assets are referenced within the application code. Incorrectly specified paths for assets (images, fonts, etc.) are a common culprit.
